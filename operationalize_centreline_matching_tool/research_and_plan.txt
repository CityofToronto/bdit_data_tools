How will the website work ?

Research: 

This article goes through different types of cloud databases (not sure if I need this):

 CGI - common gateway interface. The common gateway interface (CGI) is a standard way 
	   for a Web server to pass a Web user's request to an application program and to receive data back to forward to the user. 

	   
how to use python in HTML: 
	- http://karrigell.sourceforge.net/en/pythoninsidehtml.html
	- https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-incorporate-Python-into-HTML
	- Most of the time ppl use templates
			Templates work as a way to call HTML from a python script 
			i.e.
			template = Template(u"""<!DOCTYPE html>
			<html>
			<body>
			Hello {{ name }}! The time is {{now}}.
			</html>""")
			print template.render(name='John Doe', now=now)
			
	- There is a way to use python similar to JS <script> tags in HTML, those tags look like <% code %>
			this is called modpython, it is an Apache (a HTTP web server software) module that embeds the Python interpreter within the server
	- modpython may not work that well since python cannot run on client (i.e. on a browser). Browsers only understand HTML, JS, and CSS
	- There is something called pyjs, which translates your Python to JavaScript, which is then executed by clients' web browsers
			- it's more for if you want to write a whole application in python and then translate it to javascript
			- Which is not what I intend to do. I want to write everything in JS/HTML and then make one function call 
			to my python function that returns a new csv
	
	
How will I send data from python to JS ??

	- Flask web framework (http://flask.pocoo.org/) or Django
	
	- but first, what is a web framework ???
	The purpose of web frameworks is to hide the boilerplate and infrastructural code related to handling HTTP requests and responses. 
	Just how much is hidden depends on the framework. Django and Flask represent two extremes. 
	Django includes something for every situation, almost to its detriment. 
	Flask bills itself as a "micro-framework" and handles the bare minimum of web application functionality,
	relying on third-party packages to do some of the less common web framework tasks.

	Remember, though, that at the end of the day, Python web frameworks all work the same way: 
	they receive HTTP requests, dispatch code that generates HTML, and creates an HTTP response with that content. 
	In fact, all major server-side frameworks work in this way (excluding JavaScript frameworks). 
	Hopefully, you're now equipped to choose between frameworks as you understand their purpose.

JavaScript can also open a CSV and can perform sql queries. I looked into potentially using just JS and no python

my script currently connects to my database account .... we might need a different one for the web app ???
